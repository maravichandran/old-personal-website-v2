# maravichandran.github.io

This is my [personal website](maravichandran.github.io), built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde). 

If you'd like to learn how to use this theme, I would suggest looking at this [example site](https://github.com/jreel/jreel.github.io) by jreel.
