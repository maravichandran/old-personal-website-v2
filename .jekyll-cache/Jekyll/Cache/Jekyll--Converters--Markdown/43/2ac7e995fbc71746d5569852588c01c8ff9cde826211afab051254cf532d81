<h2 id="birding">Birding</h2>
<p>I love wildlife and have been an avid birder ever since I spotted a bird field guide on the shelf at my local library while in high school. Check out my <a href="https://www.notion.so/Birding-Life-List-b48348f3e901403597c762d92aff5497">birding life list</a>: 220 species and counting across 5 continents, complete with photos!</p>
