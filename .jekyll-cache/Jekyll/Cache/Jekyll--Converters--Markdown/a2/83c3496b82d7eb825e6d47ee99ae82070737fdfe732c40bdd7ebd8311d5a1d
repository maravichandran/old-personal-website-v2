<h3 id="performance-prediction-based-on-code-changes--mongodb">Performance Prediction Based on Code Changes @ MongoDB</h3>
<p>Currently in progress for Summer 2021!</p>

<h3 id="evergreen-ci-data-pipeline--mongodb">Evergreen CI Data Pipeline @ MongoDB</h3>
<p>During summer 2020, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>. My co-intern and I created a data pipeline within the <a href="https://github.com/evergreen-ci">Evergreen</a> continuous integration (CI) system that logs system metrics on the hosts running the CI tests, transforms them into structured data, and stores them in the data sink for access via a REST API, enabling diagnosis of system failures via machine learning and visualization of the system metric data. My code is open-source and can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/evergreen-ci/cedar/commits?author=maravichandran">Cedar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/ftdc/commits?author=maravichandran">FTDC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/commits?author=maravichandran">Evergreen</a> repositiories.</p>

<h3 id="computational-genomics-for-osteosarcoma--nih">Computational Genomics for Osteosarcoma @ NIH</h3>
<p>During Summer 2018, I worked on computational genetics for osteosarcoma in Dr. Paul Meltzerâ€™s lab at the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD. I analyzed next-generation sequencing data to search for large-scale structural rearrangements in the DNA sequences and improved the accuracy of a program to identify these mutations. Here is a poster summarizing my work that I presented at the NIH.</p>

<h3 id="sustainable-cement--princeton">Sustainable Cement @ Princeton</h3>
<p>During Summer and Fall 2016, I worked in the <a href="http://white.princeton.edu/">Sustainable Cements Group</a> at Princeton University, mentored by Prof. Claire White. Here is a poster summarizing my work that I presented at ISEF (the International Science &amp; Engineering Fair). 
â€¢	Investigated the impact of sulfate attack on the atomic structure of eco-friendly alkali-activated cement
â€¢	Analyzed eight million data points from Advanced Photon Source particle accelerator at Argonne National Laboratory 
â€¢	Identified atomic bonds using Fourier transforms and X-Ray Pair Distribution Function analysis</p>
