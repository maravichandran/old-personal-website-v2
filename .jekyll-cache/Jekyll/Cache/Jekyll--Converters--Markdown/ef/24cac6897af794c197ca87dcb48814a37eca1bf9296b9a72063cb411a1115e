<p>From 2018-2021, I was President of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rutgers_vc">Rutgers Venture Capital Club</a>. I led our team in recruiting over 20 people to the club board and led our team in launching a semester-long venture investment portfolio competition with professional VC/LP judges, a VC and entrepreneur speaker series, educational presentations, and startup pitch competitions. We also laid the foundations for a $100,000 venture grant program for student startups in partnership with <a href="https://www.business.rutgers.edu/road-silicon-valley">Rutgers RSVP</a>. In addition, we placed students into VC internships and connected VC investors and student founders.</p>
