Here are some of my favorite hobbies! 

## Birding
I love wildlife and have been an avid birder ever since I spotted a bird field guide on the shelf at my local library while in high school. Check out my [birding life list](https://www.notion.so/Birding-Life-List-b48348f3e901403597c762d92aff5497): 220 species and counting across 5 continents, complete with photos!

## Music
I am a huge fan of classical music. My favorite composer is Bach. I have played the violin for many years and have recently started composing music, which you can listen to [here](https://www.instagram.com/music.with.maya/).

## Reading
I enjoy reading and mostly read classic and contemporary novels. Here is a [list of my recent reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127838671-maya-ravichandran).
