## Computer Science

### Reproducing and Extending GraphRNN: Graph Recurrent Neural Networks for Generating Graphs
I worked on a group project to create code to reproduce the [GraphRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08773) model, achieving comparable performance in generating graphs on both qualitative and quantitative metrics. We also extended the paper by assessing model performance on additional graph similarity metrics, confirming the utility of the breadth-first search traversal with an ablation study, extending GraphRNN to directed graphs, and implementing a novel extension to generate directed acyclic graphs.

### Domain Adaptation of CNNs for Diagnosis of COVID-19 Chest X-Rays
Domain adaptation involves using a machine learning model trained on one domain to make predictions on data from another domain. I worked on a project to use domain adaptation to apply a model trained on viral pneumonia chest X-rays to diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-rays, utilizing Python, PyTorch, and convolutional neural networks. While the baseline model trained on the viral pneumonia dataset achieved a 49.50% accuracy, the domain adaptation model using domain-adversarial neural networks (DANN) achieved a 62.25% accuracy. This is useful for situations requiring unsupervised learning, which may arise during a novel disease like COVID-19.

## Leadership/Service

### Building Rutgers Entrepreneurship Community
From 2018-2021, I was President of Rutgers Venture Capital Club. I led our team in recruiting over 25 people to the club board and launching the Rutgers Venture Cup, a semester-long venture investment portfolio competition with professional VC/LP judges. I also led the execution of a VC and entrepreneur speaker series, educational presentations, and startup pitch competitions. 

### Academic Advocacy at Rutgers
From 2019-2021, I was elected to serve as the Academic Affairs chair in the Rutgers Student Government ([RUSA](https://rusa.rutgers.edu/)), representing 36,000 Rutgers students. I represented approximately 20,000 School of Arts and Sciences students as an elected Senator in the Rutgers University Senate, a governing body of administrators, faculty, staff, students, and alumni. 

I led the Academic Affairs committee in creating a survey on student experiences during COVID-18, garnering ~13,000 student responses, and presenting findings to administration, resulting in the [reinstatement of pass/no-credit policy](https://dailytargum.com/article/2020/11/rutgers-announces-pass-no-credit-optional-grading-system-for-fall-semester) in response to COVID-19 pandemic for the Fall 2020 – Spring 2021 semesters for all 48,000 undergraduates at Rutgers-Newark, New Brunswick, and Camden. 

### Advancing Rutgers CS Community
Throughout my college career, I was heavily involved with the computer science community. As VP of Education of [USACS](https://usacs.rutgers.edu), I led a team to source speakers and review presentation content for weekly [“Hacker Hour” technology lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwDoERNwcCrZICFil2fmdmA/videos) by industry representatives, alumni, professors, and students, with approximately 35 students in attendance per event.

I also spearheaded a new 1:1 mentorship program, with over 100 mentees enrolled, to match CS upperclassmen with underclassmen for holistic growth in academics and career/personal development. Approximately 70% of mentor-mentee pairs reported that they communicated at least once per week during the semester. I took on mentees of my own, with a focus on supporting women in CS.

In addition, I created the curriculum for and served as the sole instructor for an accredited Rutgers course, a [First-Year Interest Group Seminar](https://careers.rutgers.edu/students-alumni/courses-high-impact-mentoring-programs/first-year-interest-group-seminars-figs) course on Exploring Computer Science, to 24 first-year students. Lesson topics included data science, encryption, machine learning and diversity, and CS for social good.
