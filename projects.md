## Computer Science

### Domain Adaptation of CNNs for Diagnosis of COVID-19 Chest X-Rays
Domain adaptation involves using a machine learning model trained on one domain to make predictions on data from another domain. I worked on a project ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/maravichandran/covid-xray-DANN)) to use domain adaptation to apply a model trained on viral pneumonia chest X-rays to diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-rays, utilizing Python, PyTorch, and convolutional neural networks. While the baseline model trained on the viral pneumonia dataset achieved a 49.50% accuracy, the domain adaptation model using domain-adversarial neural networks (DANN) achieved a 62.25% accuracy. This is useful for situations requiring unsupervised learning, which may arise during a novel disease like COVID-19.


## Leadership/Service

### Building Rutgers Entrepreneurship Community
From 2018-2021, I was President of [Rutgers Venture Capital Club](https://www.instagram.com/rutgers_vc). I led our team in recruiting over 25 people to the club board and launching the Rutgers Venture Cup, a semester-long venture investment portfolio competition with professional VC/LP judges. I also led the execution of a VC and entrepreneur speaker series, educational presentations, and startup pitch competitions. In addition, we laid the foundations for the Venture Analyst Program, in which students can contribute to investment decisions of a  $100,000 venture grant program for student startups, in partnership with Rutgers Business School's [RSVP](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/road-silicon-valley). We also we placed students into VC internships and connected VC investors and student founders. 

### Academic Advocacy at Rutgers
From 2019-2021, I was elected to serve as the Academic Affairs chair in the Rutgers Student Government ([RUSA](https://rusa.rutgers.edu/)), representing 36,000 Rutgers students. I represented approximately 20,000 School of Arts and Sciences students as an elected Senator in the Rutgers University Senate, a governing body of administrators, faculty, staff, students, and alumni. 

I led the Academic Affairs committee in creating a survey on student experiences during COVID-18, garnering ~13,000 student responses, and presenting findings to administration, resulting in the [reinstatement of pass/no-credit policy](https://dailytargum.com/article/2020/11/rutgers-announces-pass-no-credit-optional-grading-system-for-fall-semester) in response to COVID-19 pandemic for the Fall 2020 – Spring 2021 semesters for all 48,000 undergraduates at Rutgers-Newark, New Brunswick, and Camden. 

### Advancing Rutgers CS Community
Throughout my college career, I was heavily involved with the computer science community. As VP of Education of [USACS](usacs.rutgers.edu), I led a team to source speakers and review presentation content for weekly [“Hacker Hour” technology lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwDoERNwcCrZICFil2fmdmA/videos) by industry representatives, alumni, professors, and students, with approximately 35 students in attendance per event.

I also spearheaded a new 1:1 mentorship program, with over 100 mentees enrolled, to match CS upperclassmen with underclassmen for holistic growth in academics and career/personal development. Approximately 70% of mentor-mentee pairs reported that they communicated at least once per week during the semester. I took on mentees of my own, with a focus on supporting women in CS.

In addition, I created the curriculum for and served as the sole instructor for an accredited Rutgers course, a [First-Year Interest Group Seminar](https://careers.rutgers.edu/about-us/resources-services/first-year-interest-group-seminars-figs) course on Exploring Computer Science, to 24 first-year students. Lesson topics included data science, encryption, machine learning and diversity, and CS for social good.
