### Building Rutgers Entrepreneurship Community
From 2018-2021, I was President of [Rutgers Venture Capital Club](https://www.instagram.com/rutgers_vc). I led our team in recruiting over 20 people to the club board and led our team in launching a semester-long venture investment portfolio competition with professional VC/LP judges, a VC and entrepreneur speaker series, educational presentations, and startup pitch competitions. We also laid the foundations for a $100,000 venture grant program for student startups in partnership with [Rutgers RSVP](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/road-silicon-valley). In addition, we placed students into VC internships and connected VC investors and student founders. 

### Academic Advocacy at Rutgers
From 2019-2021, I was elected to serve as the Academic Affairs chair in the Rutgers Student Government ([RUSA](https://rusa.rutgers.edu/)), representing 36,000 Rutgers students.
