### Computational Genomics for Osteosarcoma @ NIH
During summer 2018, I worked on computational genetics for osteosarcoma in Dr. Paul Meltzer's lab at the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. I analyzed next-generation sequencing data to search for large-scale structural rearrangements in the DNA sequences and improved the accuracy of a program to identify these mutations. Here is a poster summarizing my work.
