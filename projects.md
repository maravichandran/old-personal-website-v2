### Building Rutgers Entrepreneurship Community
From 2018-2021, I was President of [Rutgers Venture Capital Club](https://www.instagram.com/rutgers_vc). I led our team in recruiting over 20 people to the club board and launching the Rutgers Venture Cup, a semester-long venture investment portfolio competition with professional VC/LP judges. I also led the execution of a VC and entrepreneur speaker series, educational presentations, and startup pitch competitions. In addtion, we laid the foundations for a $100,000 venture grant program for student startups in partnership with [Rutgers RSVP](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/road-silicon-valley). We also we placed students into VC internships and connected VC investors and student founders. 

### Academic Advocacy at Rutgers
From 2019-2021, I was elected to serve as the Academic Affairs chair in the Rutgers Student Government ([RUSA](https://rusa.rutgers.edu/)), representing 36,000 Rutgers students. I represented approximately 20,000 School of Arts and Sciences students as an elected Senator in the Rutgers University Senate, a governing body of administrators, faculty, staff, students, and alumni. 
•	Led committee in creating survey, garnering ~13,000 student responses, and presenting findings to administration, resulting in reinstatement of pass/no-credit policy in response to COVID-19 pandemic for Fall 2020 – Spring 2021 semesters for all ~50,000 undergraduates at Rutgers-Newark, New Brunswick, and Camden
