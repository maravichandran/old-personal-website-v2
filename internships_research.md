## Internships

### ML for Performance Prediction @ MongoDB
Currently in progress for Summer 2021!

### Evergreen CI Data Pipeline @ MongoDB
During summer 2020, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). My co-intern and I created a data pipeline within the [Evergreen](https://evergreen.mongodb.com/) continuous integration (CI) system that logs system metrics on the hosts running the CI tests, transforms them into structured data, and stores them in the data sink for access via a REST API, enabling diagnosis of system failures via machine learning and visualization of the system metric data. My code is open-source and can be found in the [Cedar](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/cedar), [FTDC](https://github.com/mongodb/ftdc), and [Evergreen](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen) repositiories.

## Research

### Data Science for Smart Cities @ Rutgers CS
I was a Research Assistant in [Prof. Desheng Zhang's lab](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/) from 2020-2021. I worked on a project to develop privacy-preserving conflict detection and resolution of smart city services using secure multi-party computation. I also created data visualizations for smart city services in Newark, NJ and Shezhen, China. 

### Computational Genomics for Osteosarcoma @ NIH
During Summer 2018, I worked on computational genetics for osteosarcoma in [Dr. Paul Meltzer's lab](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/paul-s-meltzer) at the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD. I analyzed next-generation sequencing data to search for large-scale structural rearrangements in the DNA sequences and improved the accuracy of a program to identify these mutations using a logistic regression model.

### Sustainable Cement @ Princeton
During Summer and Fall 2016, I worked in the [Sustainable Cements Group](http://white.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, mentored by Prof. Claire White. Concrete production accounts for 8% of global CO2 emissions, and the lab studies eco-friendly cement alternatives. I investigated the impact of sulfate attack on the atomic structure of alkali-activated cement by identifying atomic bonds and conducting X-Ray Pair Distribution Function analysis on data from a particle accelerator. Here is a [poster](https://maravichandran.github.io/ISEF_poster.pdf) summarizing my work that I presented at ISEF (International Science & Engineering Fair).
